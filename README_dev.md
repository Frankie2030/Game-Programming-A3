# Gravity Courier - Development Specification Checklist

This document serves as a detailed checklist for the "Gravity Courier" platformer, mapping the requirements from `Assignment3_Platformer_Specification.pdf` to their implementation in the codebase. Each achieved item includes a comprehensive code snippet for reference.

## 2) World & Camera (3 pts total)

*   **Map size ≥4× screen area (1 pt): Example: 5120×720 (horizontal) or 1280×2880 (vertical). Player can traverse beyond a single screen.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** The world width is 4 times the screen width, allowing horizontal traversal.
        ```python
        # game/core/settings.py
        WORLD_WIDTH = 5120  # px (160 tiles)
        WORLD_HEIGHT = 720  # px (22.5 tiles, round to 23)
        SCREEN_WIDTH = 1280
        SCREEN_HEIGHT = 720
        ```
*   **Scrolling on one axis (2 pts): Horizontal or vertical camera follow; clamp at world edges; avoid jitter via smoothing or tile-aligned steps.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Horizontal camera follow with smoothing and clamping at world edges.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        self.camera = Camera(settings.WORLD_WIDTH, settings.WORLD_HEIGHT)
        self.camera.update(self.player.rect, dt)
        # game/core/settings.py
        CAMERA_SMOOTHING = 0.1
        ```

## 3) Core Interactions (3 pts total)

*   **Enemy defeat (1 pt): At least one enemy vulnerable to a specific tactic (e.g., jump-stomp) with visual/audio feedback and removal/state change.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Enemies can be defeated by stomping, projectiles, or Flux Surge.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        # Check bullet hits enemy
        if enemy.alive and bullet.rect.colliderect(enemy.rect):
            enemy.take_damage()
        # Check stomp
        elif enemy.check_stomp(self.player):
            enemy.take_damage()
        ```
*   **Breakable containers (1 pt): Crates/blocks that break via jump/attack and spawn items; update collision boxes after breaking.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Breakable blocks are implemented, can spawn items, and update collision.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        for block in self.breakables:
            if block.is_solid() and block.rect.colliderect(self.player.rect):
                item = block.hit('any')
        # game/entities/breakable.py
        def is_solid(self):
            return not self.broken
        ```
*   **Coin collection (1 pt): Coins with pickup sound and on-screen counter; persist count across the level.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Coins are collectible with sound, on-screen counter, and persist across levels.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        for coin in self.coins:
            if coin.update(dt, self.player.rect):
                self.player.collect_coin()
                self.audio.play_sfx('coin')
        # game/entities/player.py
        self.coins = 0
        def collect_coin(self):
            self.coins += 1
        ```

## 4) Special Objects (2 pts total)

*   **Boss (1 pt): Distinct enemy with HP, patterns, a telegraphed weak phase, and a clear win condition. Show boss HP; provide hit feedback.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** The `GyroBoss` is implemented with HP, phases, a vulnerable state, win condition, HP bar, and hit feedback.
        ```python
        # game/entities/boss.py
        self.hp = settings.BOSS_HP
        self.phase = 'spin_up'  # 'spin_up', 'hazard', 'recalibration'
        self.vulnerable = True  # during 'recalibration'
        # game/world/level.py
if self.boss.defeated and self.player.rect.x > settings.WORLD_WIDTH - 100:
    self.stack.replace_with_transition(WinState, self.player)
        ```
*   **Star (1 pt): Temporary power-up (~5–10 s) granting invulnerability/speed with unique visual and jingle; show timer/icon.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Flux Surge (Star) grants temporary invulnerability and speed with visual/audio feedback and a timer.
        ```python
        # game/entities/player.py
        self.flux_surge_timer = Timer()
        def activate_flux_surge(self):
            self.flux_surge_timer.start(settings.FLUX_SURGE_DURATION)
        # game/world/level.py
        if star.update(dt, self.player.rect):
            self.player.activate_flux_surge()
            self.audio.play_sfx('star')
        ```

## 5) Audio & Menu (2 pts total)

*   **Audio (1 pt): Looping BGM per level; SFX for jump, coin, crate break, enemy hit/defeat, star pickup, pause, confirm. Options for volume preferred.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Looping BGM per level, SFX for various actions, and volume options are implemented.
        ```python
        # game/io/audio.py
        self.music_volume = 0.7
        self.sfx_volume = 0.8
        def play_music(self, filepath, loops=-1):
        # game/world/level.py
        self.audio.play_music(self.audio.MUSIC_GAME)
        self.audio.play_sfx('coin')
        ```
*   **Menu (1 pt): Main Menu with New Game, Options, About, Exit; Options includes at least Music/SFX volume; About shows team, credits, controls.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Main Menu, Options, and About screens are implemented with required content.
        ```python
        # game/ui/main_menu.py
        self.options = ['Resume Game', 'Level Select', 'New Game', 'How to Play', 'Options', 'About', 'Exit']
        # game/ui/options.py
        self.audio.set_music_volume(new_vol)
        self.audio.set_sfx_volume(new_vol)
        # game/ui/about.py
        self.draw_section(content_surface, "CONTROLS", controls_items, 220, 'gravity')
        self.draw_section(content_surface, "CREDITS", credits_items, y + 20, 'star')
        ```

## 6) Game Structure & UX

*   **States: Splash (optional) → Main Menu → Gameplay → Pause → Win/Lose → Back to Menu.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** The core game state flow and transitions are implemented.
        ```python
        # game/main.py
        state_stack.push(MainMenuState)
        # game/core/state.py
        class StateStack:
            def push(self, state_class, *args, **kwargs):
            def pop(self):
            def replace(self, state_class, *args, **kwargs):
        ```
*   **Recommended: simple checkpoints; HUD shows Lives/HP, coins, optional timer, star/buff indicator, and (for boss fights) boss HP.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Simple checkpoints and a comprehensive HUD are implemented.
        ```python
        # game/entities/player.py
        def set_checkpoint(self, pos):
        def respawn(self):
        # game/ui/hud.py
        hp_text = f"HP: {player.hp}/{settings.PLAYER_HP}"
        coin_text = f"Coins: {player.coins}"
        time_text = f"Time: {game_time:.1f}s"
        if boss and boss.alive:
            boss.draw_hp_bar(screen)
        ```

## 9) Bonus Ideas

*   **Multiple enemy defeat methods (e.g., stomp and projectile; parry; lures).**
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Stomp and Projectile):** Player can stomp enemies or shoot them with bullets. Flux Surge also provides an instant kill.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        # Check bullet hits enemy
        # Check stomp
        if self.flux_surge_active:
    enemy.take_damage()
        ```
    *   ❌ **Not Achieved:** Parry, lures.
*   **Environmental puzzles that require moving objects to progress (bridges, numbered tiles, pressure plates).**
    *   ✅ **Achieved:** Level 2 includes a puzzle with buttons controlling gates.
        ```python
        # game/world/level.py
        # Wire button callbacks to gates for level 2 puzzle
        if self.level_id == 2 and len(self.buttons) >= 2 and len(self.gates) >= 3:
            self.buttons[0].on_toggle = toggle_gates_0_and_2
        ```
*   **Polish: particle effects, camera shake, squash-and-stretch, animation blending, save/load.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Particle effects):** Breakable blocks and win screen have particle effects.
        ```python
        # game/entities/breakable.py
        self.particle_offsets = [...] # For break animation
        # game/ui/win.py
        # Add animated particles
        ```
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Camera shake):** Camera shakes when player takes damage at low HP.
        ```python
        # game/entities/player.py
        if camera and previous_hp >= 2 and self.hp == 1:
            camera.shake()
        ```
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Animation):** Player walk/attack animations and star animation are present.
        ```python
        # game/entities/player.py
        self.walk_frames = []
        self.attack_frames = []
        # game/entities/star.py
        self.frames = [] # For star animation
        ```
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Save/load):** Comprehensive save/load system for game progress.
        ```python
        # game/core/save_system.py
        class SaveSystem:
            @staticmethod
            def save_game(...):
            @staticmethod
            def complete_level(...):
        ```
    *   ❌ **Not explicitly Achieved:** Squash-and-stretch, animation blending.
*   **Accessibility: color-blind safe UI, remappable keys.**
    *   ✅ **Achieved (Remappable keys):** Controls can be remapped via the Options menu.
        ```python
        # game/ui/controls.py
        self.key_bindings = stack.persistent_data.get('key_bindings', settings.DEFAULT_KEY_BINDINGS.copy())
        ```
    *   ❌ **Not Achieved:** Color-blind safe UI.
